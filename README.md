# Quadtree

`npm install wbroberts-quadtree`

```javascript
import { QuadTree, Point, AreaBoundary } from 'wbroberts-quadtree';
```

This project was to learn about quadtree data structures. My goal was to successfully create one that I would be able to use in 2d canvas games for the web. A goal of this was to increase performance of collision detection in little games
